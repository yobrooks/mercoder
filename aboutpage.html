            <p>Mercoder is short for "Mercer Coder."  
                Mercer University, in Macon, Georgia USA, developed Mercoder as part of Mercer on Mission (MOM). 
                It was created to give Mercer students the opportunity to teach some computer coding skills to young people around the world. 
                We hope you enjoy the lessons offered, and learn how to seek guidance to improve your coding skills in the future.
